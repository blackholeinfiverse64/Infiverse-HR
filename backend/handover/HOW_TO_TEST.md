## 🚀 **QUICK START (5 Minutes)**

### **Step 1: Environment Setup**
```bash
# Option A: Use Live Production (Recommended - No Setup)
Gateway: https://bhiv-hr-gateway-ltg0.onrender.com
HR Portal: https://bhiv-hr-portal-u670.onrender.com
Client Portal: https://bhiv-hr-client-portal-3iod.onrender.com
Candidate Portal: https://bhiv-hr-candidate-portal-abe6.onrender.com

# Option B: Local Docker (Verified Working)
cd "c:\BHIV HR PLATFORM"
docker-compose -f docker-compose.production.yml up -d
# Wait 30 seconds for initialization
# Verify: docker-compose -f docker-compose.production.yml ps
# Expected: 7 containers all "Up" and "healthy"

# Local URLs:
# Gateway: http://localhost:8000
# Agent: http://localhost:9000  
# LangGraph: http://localhost:9001
# HR Portal: http://localhost:8501
# Client Portal: http://localhost:8502
# Candidate Portal: http://localhost:8503
```

### **Step 2: Verify System Health**
```bash
# Test all services are running
curl https://bhiv-hr-gateway-ltg0.onrender.com/health
curl https://bhiv-hr-agent-nhgg.onrender.com/health
curl https://bhiv-hr-langgraph.onrender.com/health

# Expected: All return {"status": "healthy"}
```

### **Step 3: Get API Key**
```bash
# API Key for testing (from config/local.env)
API_KEY_SECRET="prod_api_key_XUqM2msdCa4CYIaRywRNXRVc477nlI3AQ-lr6cgTB2o"

# Test API access
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $API_KEY_SECRET" \
  https://bhiv-hr-gateway-ltg0.onrender.com/v1/candidates/stats
```

### **Step 4: Import Postman Collection**
```bash
# File: handover/postman_collection.json
# Contains all 111 endpoints organized in 23 folders
# Import into Postman and set environment variables
```

  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"client_id":"TECH001","password":"demo123"}'
# Save JWT as TECH001_TOKEN

# Login as different client (if available)
curl -X POST https://bhiv-hr-gateway-ltg0.onrender.com/v1/client/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"client_id":"STARTUP01","password":"demo123"}'
# Save JWT as STARTUP01_TOKEN

# Test cross-tenant access (should fail)
# Try to access TECH001 jobs with STARTUP01 token
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $STARTUP01_TOKEN" \
  https://bhiv-hr-gateway-ltg0.onrender.com/v1/jobs

# Expected: Only see STARTUP01 jobs, not TECH001 jobs
```

#### **8.2 Authorization Testing**
```bash
# Test endpoint access with different auth types

# API Key access (should work for all)
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $API_KEY" \
  https://bhiv-hr-gateway-ltg0.onrender.com/v1/candidates

# Client JWT access (should work for client endpoints)
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $CLIENT_JWT" \
  https://bhiv-hr-gateway-ltg0.onrender.com/v1/jobs

# Expected: Input sanitized and blocked
```

**✅ PASS CRITERIA**: Tenant isolation enforced, authorization works correctly, security attacks blocked

---

## 🚨 **CRITICAL VALIDATION POINTS**

### **Must Verify These Work:**
1. ✅ **All 111 endpoints respond** (use Postman collection)
2. ✅ **AI matching returns real scores** (not random numbers)
3. ✅ **Notifications actually send** (check email/WhatsApp delivery)
4. ✅ **Tenant isolation enforced** (clients can't see each other's data)
5. ✅ **Database transactions work** (bulk operations don't leave partial data)
6. ✅ **Error handling graceful** (no system crashes on invalid input)

### **Must Verify These Are Mocked:**
1. ⚠️ **RL training is mocked** (returns fake model versions)
2. ⚠️ **HR user authentication missing** (only API key works)
3. ⚠️ **File uploads not implemented** (resume_path fields exist but no upload)
4. ⚠️ **Advanced AI features limited** (basic matching only)
