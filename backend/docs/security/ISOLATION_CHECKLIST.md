# Tenant Isolation Checklist

## Overview
This document outlines the comprehensive checklist for verifying tenant isolation mechanisms in the BHIV Application Framework. Tenant isolation is a critical security feature that ensures data separation between different tenants in the multi-tenant SaaS architecture.

## Core Isolation Mechanisms

### 1. Tenant Resolution Service
- [ ] Tenant ID is automatically resolved from JWT tokens
- [ ] Tenant ID is extracted from request headers when JWT is not available
- [ ] Tenant resolution middleware injects tenant context into all requests
- [ ] Invalid tenant IDs are properly rejected
- [ ] Default tenant handling is implemented for unauthenticated requests

### 2. Cross-Tenant Access Prevention
- [ ] Cross-tenant access validation prevents unauthorized data access
- [ ] Tenant isolation checks are performed at the database level
- [ ] SQL query filters are automatically generated based on tenant ID
- [ ] Shared resources are properly identified and accessed according to tenant permissions
- [ ] Tenant-aware tables are isolated per tenant (jobs, applications, interviews, offers)
- [ ] Shared data (candidates) is accessed with proper tenant context

### 3. Database-Level Isolation
- [ ] All tenant-specific data includes tenant_id field
- [ ] Database queries automatically filter by tenant_id
- [ ] No direct access to cross-tenant data is possible
- [ ] Indexes are created on tenant_id fields for performance
- [ ] Foreign key constraints respect tenant boundaries

### 4. API-Level Isolation
- [ ] All API endpoints validate tenant access before processing
- [ ] Tenant ID is validated against the authenticated user's tenant
- [ ] Response data is filtered to show only tenant-specific records
- [ ] Tenant isolation checks are enforced in middleware
- [ ] Error messages don't reveal existence of cross-tenant resources

## Authentication & Authorization Integration

### 5. Dual Authentication Support
- [ ] Both API key and JWT token authentication work with tenant isolation
- [ ] API key users have appropriate tenant context
- [ ] JWT token users have tenant context extracted from claims
- [ ] Authentication middleware integrates with tenant resolution
- [ ] Token validation respects tenant boundaries

### 6. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- [ ] Role enforcement respects tenant boundaries
- [ ] Tenant-scoped roles are properly enforced
- [ ] Cross-tenant role assignments are prevented
- [ ] Permission checks consider tenant context
- [ ] Role assignments are validated against tenant membership

## Security Controls

### 7. Audit Logging Integration
- [ ] All tenant access is logged with tenant context
- [ ] Cross-tenant access attempts are logged as security events
- [ ] Audit trails include tenant ID for all operations
- [ ] Audit logs are tenant-isolated
- [ ] Security events related to tenant isolation are properly captured

### 8. Workflow Engine Isolation
- [ ] Workflow instances are created within tenant context
- [ ] Cross-tenant workflow access is prevented
- [ ] Workflow data is isolated by tenant
- [ ] Workflow permissions respect tenant boundaries
- [ ] Workflow execution doesn't cross tenant boundaries

## Testing Procedures

### 9. Isolation Validation Tests
- [ ] Test that User A from Tenant X cannot access data from Tenant Y
- [ ] Verify that API calls return only tenant-specific data
- [ ] Confirm that database queries are automatically filtered by tenant
- [ ] Validate that tenant resolution works across all endpoints
- [ ] Ensure that error responses don't leak cross-tenant information

### 10. Edge Case Testing
- [ ] Test with malformed JWT tokens
- [ ] Verify behavior when tenant_id is missing from token
- [ ] Test cross-tenant access attempts with valid credentials
- [ ] Validate tenant isolation during bulk operations
- [ ] Check tenant isolation during workflow execution

## Integration Points

### 11. Adapter Integration
- [ ] All integration adapters respect tenant boundaries
- [ ] Adapter callbacks include proper tenant context
- [ ] Cross-tenant adapter interactions are prevented
- [ ] Adapter data storage respects tenant isolation
- [ ] Adapter permissions are validated against tenant context

### 12. Client Portal Integration
- [ ] Client registrations are properly isolated by tenant
- [ ] Client login validates tenant context
- [ ] Client-specific data is properly isolated
- [ ] Cross-client access is prevented
- [ ] Client permissions respect tenant boundaries

## Performance Considerations

### 13. Performance Validation
- [ ] Tenant filtering doesn't significantly impact query performance
- [ ] Indexes are properly utilized for tenant filtering
- [ ] Middleware overhead is minimized
- [ ] Cache keys include tenant context to prevent cross-tenant cache access
- [ ] Session management respects tenant boundaries

## Known Limitations

### 14. Current Limitations (from TENANT_ASSUMPTIONS.md)
- [ ] No automatic tenant filtering at the database level (currently manual in queries)
- [ ] No tenant administration features (tenant creation, management, deletion)
- [ ] No advanced isolation features (sub-tenants, cross-tenant collaboration)
- [ ] No tenant-specific configuration management
- [ ] No tenant resource quotas or limits

## Verification Steps

### 15. Pre-Deployment Verification
- [ ] Run comprehensive tenant isolation test suite
- [ ] Verify audit logs capture all tenant access
- [ ] Confirm RBAC permissions work with tenant context
- [ ] Test edge cases and error conditions
- [ ] Validate performance under multi-tenant load

### 16. Post-Deployment Monitoring
- [ ] Monitor for cross-tenant access attempts
- [ ] Track tenant isolation performance metrics
- [ ] Log and investigate any tenant boundary violations
- [ ] Regular auditing of tenant data access patterns
- [ ] Monitor for any data leakage between tenants

## Compliance & Governance

### 17. Regulatory Compliance
- [ ] Tenant isolation meets data residency requirements
- [ ] Cross-border data transfer restrictions are respected
- [ ] GDPR/privacy regulation compliance for tenant data
- [ ] Audit trail requirements are satisfied
- [ ] Data segregation requirements for sensitive data

## Emergency Procedures

### 18. Breach Response
- [ ] Procedures for detecting tenant isolation breaches
- [ ] Incident response for cross-tenant data access
- [ ] Data breach notification procedures
- [ ] Tenant notification requirements
- [ ] Remediation steps for isolation failures
