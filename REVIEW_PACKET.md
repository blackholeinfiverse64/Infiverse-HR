# BHIV Sampada — Workforce Governance Review Packet

**Status**: Workforce governance runtime completed for gateway, control-center visibility, docs, and baseline tests; **Live WO/GE/SETU Sprint live runtime evidence captured (workforce / governance / policy / SETU / lineage / control-center)**  
**Maintained by**: Shashank (Sampada, Support Builder)  
**For Acceptance Review By**: Rishabh Yadav  
**Updated**: 2026-07-02

> Operational boundary remains unchanged: Sampada is a visibility and intelligence surface; execution authority stays with owning systems and approved owners.

---

## State Block

- Workforce governance backend modules are present and compile under gateway app.
- Route bundle is wired through `backend/services/gateway/app/main.py`.
- Control-center governance panel is visible only when `VITE_ENABLE_GOVERNANCE=true`.
- Runtime docs and evidence artifacts are present under `docs/` and `evidence/workforce_runtime/`; the seven Live WO/GE/SETU Sprint phase evidence docs live in the sprint folder `Live WO, GE & SETU Participation Sprint (Sampada Convergence and Expansion Builder)/`.
- **Live WO/GE/SETU Sprint (2026-06-27)**: end-to-end runtime usage captured across 8 phases (68 API calls, 67×200 + 1×404 negative path) in one continuous session with a single correlation id threading workforce → audit → SETU. Two additive runtime gap fixes applied (`transition_type`/`employee_promotion`; `schema_version` confirmed present). New evidence bundle: `evidence/live_workforce_governance_setu/`.
- **Live deployment addendum (2026-07-02)**: deployed-gateway capture completed via `evidence/live_workforce_governance_setu/harness/run_capture_live.py` against `https://bhiv-hr-gateway-l0xp.onrender.com`; run `20260702T063831Z` produced **41/41 HTTP 200** with live IDs and full capture under `evidence/live_workforce_governance_setu/live/20260702T063831Z/`.
- **Partner-initiated SETU closeout (2026-07-02)**: all four partners dispatched real HTTP to live SETU gateway at **Tier 2**; evidence `evidence/live_workforce_governance_setu/partner_live/20260702T073708Z/` (signal ids: Artha `sig-9802342a158c`, CRM `sig-5ffbd0b0bde4`, Logistics `sig-3acbbfa3ca0a`, Niyantran `sig-29f9efbb899a`).

## Live WO/GE/SETU Sprint — Live WO / GE / SETU Participation Evidence (2026-06-27)

**Sprint**: Live WO, GE & SETU Participation Sprint (Sampada Convergence and Expansion Builder). **Status**: evidence captured (local in-process runtime); awaiting owner acceptance.

> Environment note: Live WO/GE/SETU Sprint captures are **local in-process** runtime (real `workforce_governance_routes` router over in-memory async Mongo) because no deployed-gateway credentials/Mongo were available in this environment. Real request/response/status/timestamp; not the deployed Render gateway. This is stated in every Live WO/GE/SETU Sprint evidence doc header.

- **Workforce Operations Evidence** → `Live WO, GE & SETU Participation Sprint (Sampada Convergence and Expansion Builder)/LIVE_WORKFORCE_OPERATIONS_EVIDENCE.md` — one employee (`wf-bf29e5b85bc4`) Created→Assigned→Transferred→Promoted→Moved→Offboarding-Initiated→Replay (13-event ordered reconstruction; `employee_promotion` action via Gap Fix #1).
- **Hierarchy Validation** → `Live WO, GE & SETU Participation Sprint (Sampada Convergence and Expansion Builder)/ORG_HIERARCHY_VALIDATION.md` — Org→Division→Unit→Department→Team→Employee; inheritance (`[org_member, analyst]`); admin sees 3 vs client/tenant 0 (boundary); unknown org → 404.
- **Governance Replay** → `Live WO, GE & SETU Participation Sprint (Sampada Convergence and Expansion Builder)/GOVERNANCE_REPLAY_EVIDENCE.md` — 3 scenarios (leave/visibility/approval) full chain `Policy→Eval→Challenge→Review→Override→Decision→Replay`; Leave has a 2-link supersedes replay chain.
- **Policy Replay** → `Live WO, GE & SETU Participation Sprint (Sampada Convergence and Expansion Builder)/POLICY_REPLAY_VALIDATION.md` — policy-state angle; overrides do not version the definition; re-evaluations confirm context-driven outcomes.
- **SETU Participation** → `Live WO, GE & SETU Participation Sprint (Sampada Convergence and Expansion Builder)/SETU_PARTICIPATION_EVIDENCE.md` — all 4 signal types ingested/listed/traced; niyantran linked to lifecycle trace (1 signal + 14 audits). **Verified vs Simulated**: Sampada-side ingestion/lineage/trace/replay = **Verified (runtime-proven)**; external-system-initiated participation = **Not Yet Available — Blocked on external owner integration**.
- **Ownership Metadata & Lineage Validation** → `Live WO, GE & SETU Participation Sprint (Sampada Convergence and Expansion Builder)/LINEAGE_PROPAGATION_EVIDENCE.md` — 7/7 fields (incl. `schema_version=1.0.0`) present in workforce, governance, and SETU samples; one correlation id propagated across workforce + audit + SETU.
- **Control Center Evidence** → `Live WO, GE & SETU Participation Sprint (Sampada Convergence and Expansion Builder)/CONTROL_CENTER_EVIDENCE.md` — `audit-events` (38 total / 14 for lifecycle cid) and `audit-replay` (14 ordered) via real read endpoints; Observation→Execution boundary mapping; frontend UI screenshot is a stated limitation.
- **Testing Results** → `evidence/live_workforce_governance_setu/test_results/pytest_final.txt`: **29 passed, 6 warnings**; `compileall` success. After-gap-fix run: 24 passed (no regression).
- **Replay Results (Live WO/GE/SETU Sprint consolidated)**:
  - Workforce trace-replay by correlation id → 13 ordered events (`GET /v1/workforce/trace-replay`).
  - Decision replay → Leave 2-link supersedes chain; Visibility & Approval 1-link (`GET /v1/decisions/replay`).
  - SETU trace continuity → 4 signals reconstructed; niyantran cross-system (1 signal + 14 audits) (`GET /v1/setu/trace/{trace_id}`).
  - Control Center audit-replay → 14 ordered events for the lifecycle correlation id.
- **Evidence bundle** → `evidence/live_workforce_governance_setu/` (`SUMMARY.md`, `capture_index.json`, `full_capture.json`, per-phase JSON, `addendum/`, `test_results/`, `harness/`).

### Reviewer-findings reconciliation (against the actual `Review Feedback (… Sampada – Convergence And Expansion Builder).md`)

The five findings of the real reviewer document were read in full and mapped to Live WO/GE/SETU Sprint evidence:

| # | Reviewer finding | Live WO/GE/SETU Sprint status |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Runtime Existence ≠ Runtime Convergence (prove sustained/real/scale usage, not just compile+unit+endpoints) | **Partially addressed** — real end-to-end runtime usage + cross-system trace captured; **sustained production usage / operational scale** remain unproven (local in-process capture, not deployed). |
| 2 | SETU still mostly internal (Niyantran/Artha/CRM/**Logistics**); live ecosystem participation not proven | **Honestly unchanged** — Sampada-side ingestion/lineage/replay = Verified; external-initiated participation = Not Yet Available (all four incl. Logistics named). "Live ecosystem participation" deliberately not claimed. |
| 3 | Workforce needs real org proof (multi-org, multi-dept, inheritance, transfer, permission propagation, realistic datasets) | **Addressed** — `Live WO, GE & SETU Participation Sprint (Sampada Convergence and Expansion Builder)/ORG_HIERARCHY_VALIDATION.md` incl. supplemental **multi-org** capture (2 orgs, disjoint listings, per-org inheritance) + transfers + inheritance in Phase 1/2. |
| 4 | Policy engine operational validation (conflicts, override chains, challenge lifecycle, escalation, replay) | **Mostly addressed** — challenge lifecycle/escalation/override chains/replay proven; **policy conflicts = not a present runtime capability**, flagged not fabricated. |
| 5 | Decision ledger replay demonstration (Decision→Challenge→Review→Override→Final) | **Addressed** — consolidated correlation-linked replay packet in `Live WO, GE & SETU Participation Sprint (Sampada Convergence and Expansion Builder)/GOVERNANCE_REPLAY_EVIDENCE.md` (workforce trace-replay + control-center audit-replay), plus a 2-link supersedes chain. |

## Live WO/GE/SETU Sprint — Partner-Initiated SETU Participation Closeout (2026-07-02 →)

**Status**: **Executed 2026-07-02** — all four partner systems produced real outbound HTTP to the live Sampada SETU gateway. Evidence at `evidence/live_workforce_governance_setu/partner_live/20260702T073708Z/`.

| Partner | Tier | Sampada signal_id | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| Artha | Tier 2 | `sig-9802342a158c` | `artha_payroll_visibility_capture.json` |
| CRM | Tier 2 | `sig-5ffbd0b0bde4` | `crm_participation_capture.json` |
| Logistics | Tier 2 | `sig-3acbbfa3ca0a` | `logistics_crm_participation_capture.json` |
| Niyantran | Tier 2 | `sig-29f9efbb899a` | `niyantran_telemetry_capture.json` |

**Auth**: `API_KEY_SECRET` is the partner-facing Bearer token; `GATEWAY_SECRET_KEY` returned 401.

**Code changes (additive only, partner repos)**:
- Artha: `sampadaAdapter.js`; `signalEngine.service.js` + `signal.controller.js` re-pointed to `/v1/setu/signals/artha_payroll_visibility`
- CRM: `sampada_dispatcher.py`; hook in `telemetry_layer.py`
- Niyantran: `setuDispatcher.js`; hook in `executionEventEmitter.js`

**Sampada contract**: unchanged (`setu_participation.py`, route paths frozen).

**Two decisions flagged for Rishabh, not resolved by this execution:**
1. Should Logistics get its own SETU `signal_type` in Sampada's schema in a future sprint, or continue riding inside `crm_participation` with a `subsystem` marker?
2. Tier 2 (dispatcher invoked directly, partner server not booted) was the achievable evidence tier in this session — is that an acceptable final answer, or does closure require Tier 1 full partner-server business flows in a shared test environment?

**Security note**: rotate `API_KEY_SECRET` / `GATEWAY_SECRET_KEY` after this capture (plaintext exposure during planning — see Implementation.md §0.3).

## Risks

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|
| Routes depend on runtime Mongo collections existing | Medium | Seed/initialize required collections during deployment checks |
| Governance tab visibility for all tenants | Medium | Owner approved (GOV-PANEL-001); remains behind `VITE_ENABLE_GOVERNANCE` env flag for rollback |
| Warning-only pytest marks (`e2e_unit`) may hide marker taxonomy drift | Low | Register custom marks in pytest config in a follow-up cleanup |
| Replay evidence currently template-driven in docs, not full prod trace capture | Medium (partially mitigated) | Live WO/GE/SETU Sprint captured real ordered replay chains (workforce/decision/SETU/control-center) — but as **local in-process** runtime, not deployed prod. Re-run against deployed gateway + persistent Mongo for production-signed samples. |
| Governance panel enablement | Low | GOV-PANEL-001 approved — see docs/GOVERNANCE_PANEL_APPROVAL_RECORD.md; enabled in production |
| **SETU external participation — partner-initiated live** | Medium | **Partially closed (2026-07-02)**: all four partners dispatched real HTTP to live gateway at **Tier 2** (`partner_live/20260702T073708Z/`). Tier 1 (full partner-server business flow) not yet proven. |
| **SETU external participation — Tier 1 full flows** | Medium | Partner API servers not started this session; Artha dispatch route is JWT-gated. Owner decision: is Tier 2 sufficient for sprint closure? |
| **Logistics signal_type vs subsystem marker** | Low | Logistics rides `crm_participation` + `payload.subsystem: "logistics"`; no separate Sampada signal type. Owner decision pending. |
| **Live WO/GE/SETU Sprint evidence is local in-process, not deployed-gateway** | Low (partially retired) | Deployed-gateway run now captured (`live/20260702T063831Z`, 41×200). Keep local in-process bundle as supplemental deterministic harness evidence. |
| `transition_type` field is additive but only positively tested | Low | New `test_live_workforce_governance_setu_gapfix.py` covers promotion vs lateral audit action; negative-path/validation tests (e.g. invalid transition_type) not yet added. |
| Policy-conflict resolution not a runtime capability (Review Feedback #4) | Medium | `_evaluate_rules` is single-policy; no conflict engine exists. Not built this sprint (two-additive-fixes-only). Needs owner decision on whether multi-policy conflict resolution is in scope for a future sprint. |
| Sustained production usage & operational scale unproven (Review Feedback #1) | Medium | Live WO/GE/SETU Sprint proves linked end-to-end runtime usage but is a single local in-process session, not sustained/scaled deployed traffic. Re-run against deployed gateway with volume for scale evidence. |
| Partner-originated live SETU signals (Tier 1 full server flows) | Medium | Tier 2 partner dispatch verified 2026-07-02; full partner-server business-path triggers not exercised. |
| Agent service intermittent reachability in prod smoke | Low | `run_comprehensive_evaluation.py` result 32/33 with one timeout on `health_agent`; rerun health-only checks in approved window if this becomes recurring. |
