## What Enabling This Panel Does

When `VITE_ENABLE_GOVERNANCE=true` is set in the frontend environment and redeployed to Vercel:

- Organization count is visible on the Control Center dashboard
- Policy registry and policy count are visible
- Challenge count and open challenge list are visible
- Decision count and decision list (read-only) are visible
- SETU signal count by signal type is visible
- Workforce trace replay events are browsable

All data shown is **read-only observation**. No execution capability is added.

---

## What This Panel Does NOT Do

- Does not grant authority to execute decisions
- Does not expose payroll amounts or individual salary data
- Does not add surveillance, tracking, or employee ranking capability
- Does not create any new data — only surfaces existing audit/trace data
- Does not change any role permissions or access control rules

---

## Boundary Statement

> **Visibility ≠ Authority.**
> Enabling this panel makes governance data observable to authorized operators.
> It does not transfer ownership of any system, decision, or data asset.
> Payroll ownership remains with Artha. Execution authority remains with designated governors.
> This panel is a diagnostic and oversight instrument only.

2. Trigger a Vercel redeploy
3. No data is deleted. No backend change required.
