## Scenario Narrative

Three independent, complete governance scenarios were executed end-to-end through the real runtime: **Leave**, **Visibility**, and **Approval** policy domains. Each followed the required flow `Policy Created → Policy Evaluated → Challenge Raised → Review Assigned → Review Completed → Override Proposed → Override Applied → Decision Recorded → Replay Generated`. Every evaluation produced a `deny` (the condition that motivates a challenge), each review was completed `upheld`, each override was proposed then applied, and a decision was recorded and replayed. The Leave scenario additionally recorded a superseding decision to demonstrate a genuine multi-link replay chain. Each scenario ran under its own correlation id so its audit trail is independently reconstructable.

## Replay Confirmation

- **Scenario A** decision replay (`GET /v1/decisions/replay?decision_id=dec-847bc3155d34`) returned `replay_type=supersedes_chain` with a **2-link chain** `[dec-502dd9179340 → dec-847bc3155d34]`, proving superseded-decision reconstruction from the ledger.
- **Scenarios B & C** decision replays returned single-link supersedes chains for their recorded decisions.
- The decision-record (`POST /v1/decisions`) used the runtime endpoint cleanly (it accepts `challenge_id`, `review_id`, `trace_references`, and `supersedes` directly), so that endpoint was chosen over `/v1/governance/reviews/{id}/decision` (which takes query params only).

## Consolidated replay packet (supplemental — Review Feedback finding #5)

The reviewer's finding #5 ("Decision Ledger Needs Replay Demonstration") asks for a single **replay packet** reconstructing `Decision → Challenge → Review → Override → Final State`. The three scenarios above prove each link; this supplemental capture reconstructs the whole chain from **one correlation id** (`6fc87bbd-32a7-451b-b6be-bf677fcde457`) using two real replay surfaces. Raw: `evidence/live_workforce_governance_setu/addendum/multiorg_and_replay_packet.json`.

Packet object IDs (real): evaluation `peval-5d2d1a1f709c` → challenge `chl-24304516b790` → review `rev-3294164d3184` (**outcome=upheld** = Review/Final) → override `wovr-689f1967576e` (**status=applied** = Override/Final) → decision `dec-8dc496d8ca66`.

| Replay surface | Endpoint | Reconstructed sequence | Count | HTTP | Timestamp (UTC) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Workforce trace-replay | `GET /v1/workforce/trace-replay?correlation_id=6fc87bbd…` | policy_evaluate → challenge_create → review_assign → workflow_override_record → decision_record | 5 | 200 | 10:27:47.533450Z |
| Control Center audit-replay | `GET /v1/control-center/audit-replay?correlation_id=6fc87bbd…` | decision_record → workflow_override_record → review_assign → challenge_create → policy_evaluate (grouped, newest-first) | 5 | 200 | 10:27:47.540859Z |

This is a single, correlation-linked packet that ties the Decision back through Override, Review, Challenge to the originating policy evaluation — i.e. the governance lineage reconstructs in one query, not just per-endpoint. ("Final State" = review outcome `upheld` + override `applied` + recorded decision.) Note `review_complete` and `override_apply` do not themselves write audit rows in the current runtime, so they appear as state transitions on the review/override objects rather than as separate replay events — documented honestly rather than implied.

## Policy-conflict note (Review Feedback finding #4)

Finding #4 also lists "policy conflicts." The current `policy_engine` runtime evaluates one `policy_key` at a time against its own rules (`_evaluate_rules`); it has **no multi-policy conflict-resolution mechanism**. Per the two-additive-fixes-only constraint, no such feature was invented for this sprint. Policy-conflict resolution is therefore recorded as **not a present runtime capability / not yet proven** (carried in `REVIEW_PACKET.md` Risks and `POLICY_REPLAY_VALIDATION.md`), rather than fabricated.

## Known Limitations

- Local in-process runtime capture (see Phase 1 header).
