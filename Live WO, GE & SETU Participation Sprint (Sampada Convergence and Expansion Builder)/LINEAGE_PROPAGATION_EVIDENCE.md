# Ownership Metadata & Lineage Propagation Evidence (Live WO/GE/SETU Sprint · Phase 6)

**Date**: 2026-06-27
**Gateway base URL**: in-process FastAPI app mounting the real `routes/workforce_governance_routes.py` router
**Environment**: local in-process runtime over in-memory async Mongo (`mongomock_motor`) — real runtime code path; not deployed
**Auth type used**: API key (platform/admin)
**Status**: `live_capture` (local in-process runtime capture; reuses captures from Phases 1, 3, 5 — no re-run)
**Raw capture**: `evidence/live_workforce_governance_setu/lineage/phase6_lineage.json`

## Scenario Narrative

This phase proves that the ownership/lineage envelope propagates across three different subsystems and that a single correlation id genuinely threads more than one system. Gap Fix #2 (`schema_version`) was **confirmed already present** in `app/lineage_envelope.py` (`schema_version: str = "1.0.0"`, emitted by `to_dict()`), and it appears in every captured envelope. Three cross-system samples (a workforce employee from Phase 1, a governance decision from Phase 3, a SETU signal from Phase 5) each carry all seven required fields. End-to-end propagation is demonstrated by following the lifecycle correlation id `9fda459e-1916-42f8-81d1-f9a6f7d7f7ec` from the workforce lifecycle into the audit ledger and into the linked niyantran SETU signal.

## Field-by-field presence (3 cross-system samples)

| Field | Workforce employee (Phase 1) | Governance decision (Phase 3, Leave) | SETU signal (Phase 5, niyantran) |
|---|---|---|---|
| origin_system | gateway | gateway | niyantran |
| owning_system | sampada | sampada | niyantran |
| schema_version | **1.0.0** | **1.0.0** | **1.0.0** |
| trace_id | 9fda459e-…-7f7ec | c8cd9063-…-83e83 | 9fda459e-…-7f7ec |
| correlation_id | 9fda459e-…-7f7ec | c8cd9063-…-83e83 | 9fda459e-…-7f7ec |
| trust_classification | canonical | canonical | observed |
| visibility_scope | tenant | tenant | tenant |

All seven required fields (`origin_system`, `owning_system`, `schema_version`, `trace_id`, `correlation_id`, `trust_classification`, `visibility_scope`) are present in all three samples. Note the meaningful difference in `origin_system`/`owning_system`/`trust_classification`: Sampada-authored objects are `gateway/sampada/canonical`, while an external-declared SETU signal is `niyantran/niyantran/observed` — ownership metadata is not flattened.

## End-to-end propagation (one correlation id across systems)

`GET /v1/setu/trace/9fda459e-1916-42f8-81d1-f9a6f7d7f7ec` (the Phase 1 lifecycle correlation id) returned:

- **signal_count = 1** — the niyantran SETU signal (`sig-a101a7ebdd58`), proving a SETU signal joined the workforce trace.
- **audit_count = 14** — the 13 workforce-lifecycle audit events (`organization_create` … `employee_offboard_prepare`) **plus** `setu_signal_niyantran_telemetry`, all carrying the same `correlation_id`.

This is presence **and** propagation: the same correlation/trace id is observable in the workforce object, in every workforce audit row, and in a cross-system SETU signal — not three unrelated objects that merely each contain a lineage block.

## Step / Evidence Table

| Item | Source call | Result | HTTP |
|---|---|---|---|
| schema_version confirmation | code (`app/lineage_envelope.py`) + every captured envelope | present, `1.0.0` | n/a |
| Workforce sample | Phase 1 `POST /v1/workforce/employees` | 7/7 fields | 200 |
| Governance sample | Phase 3 `POST /v1/decisions` (Leave) | 7/7 fields | 200 |
| SETU sample | Phase 5 `POST /v1/setu/signals/niyantran_telemetry` | 7/7 fields | 200 |
| Cross-system trace | `GET /v1/setu/trace/9fda459e…` | 1 signal + 14 audits, shared correlation_id | 200 |

## Known Limitations

- Local in-process runtime capture (see Phase 1 header).
