# Live Workforce Operations Evidence (Live WO/GE/SETU Sprint · Phase 1)

**Date**: 2026-06-27
**Gateway base URL**: in-process FastAPI app mounting the real `routes/workforce_governance_routes.py` router
**Environment**: local in-process runtime over in-memory async Mongo (`mongomock_motor`) — real runtime code path; **not** the deployed Render gateway and **not** a persistent DB
**Auth type used**: API key → platform/admin scope (`assert_workforce_access`)
**Status**: `live_capture` (local in-process runtime capture; every ID/timestamp below is produced by an actually-executed call in this session)
**Raw capture**: `evidence/live_workforce_governance_setu/workforce_operations/phase1_capture.json` · master index `evidence/live_workforce_governance_setu/capture_index.json`

> Owner / acceptance authority: Rishabh Yadav. The Convergence & Expansion Builder executes and surfaces evidence only — no architecture or acceptance authority.

## Scenario Narrative

One real employee record (**R. Mehta**, `workforce_ref_id = wf-bf29e5b85bc4`) was threaded through the complete federated workforce lifecycle in a single continuous session, under one correlation id `9fda459e-1916-42f8-81d1-f9a6f7d7f7ec`. The organization → division → unit → three departments scaffold was created, then the employee progressed Draft → Onboarding → Active (Assigned) → Transferred (dept B) → Promoted (`transition_type=promotion`) → Moved (dept C) → Offboarding-Initiated. A final `trace-replay` reconstructed all 13 events in chronological order, confirming the required path `Created → Assigned → Transferred → Promoted → Moved → Offboarding Initiated → Replay Reconstruction`. The `Promoted` step is distinguishable from a lateral role move because Gap Fix #1 emits the dedicated audit action `employee_promotion`.

| 13 (Offboarding) | `POST …/lifecycle/offboard-prepare` | reason=Begin offboarding | lifecycle_state: active → **offboarding_prep** | 200 | 2026-06-27T10:27:12.101896Z |
| 14 (Replay) | `GET /v1/workforce/trace-replay?correlation_id=9fda459e…` | — | event_count=**13** | 200 | 2026-06-27T10:27:12.106239Z |

All write responses carried the lineage envelope `{origin_system: gateway, owning_system: sampada, schema_version: 1.0.0, trace_id/correlation_id: 9fda459e…, trust_classification: canonical, visibility_scope: tenant}`.

## Replay Confirmation

`GET /v1/workforce/trace-replay?correlation_id=9fda459e-1916-42f8-81d1-f9a6f7d7f7ec` returned 13 events in this exact chronological order:

1. `organization_create` (10:27:12.005)
2. `division_create` (10:27:12.013)
3. `unit_create` (10:27:12.024)
4. `department_create` (10:27:12.036)
5. `department_create` (10:27:12.046)
6. `department_create` (10:27:12.052)
7. `employee_create` (10:27:12.060)
8. `employee_onboard` (10:27:12.072)
9. `employee_onboard_complete` (10:27:12.080)
10. `employee_department_transfer` (10:27:12.087) — **Transferred**
11. `employee_promotion` (10:27:12.092) — **Promoted** (distinct action via Gap Fix #1)
12. `employee_department_transfer` (10:27:12.100) — **Moved**
13. `employee_offboard_prepare` (10:27:12.105) — **Offboarding Initiated**

The ordered chain matches steps 1–13 above and proves the required replay path reconstructs correctly from the audit ledger.

## Known Limitations

- This is a **local in-process runtime capture**, not a deployed-gateway capture. The runtime code executed is the real route layer and the real `app/*` runtime functions; persistence is an ephemeral in-memory Mongo. No credentials for the deployed Render gateway were available in this environment, and fabricating deployed responses is forbidden (§0.1).
