## 3. Key Indexes (from `seed_mongodb.py` + gateway migrations)

| Collection | Index |
|-----------|-------|
| `candidates` | `email` (unique), `status`, `created_at` |
| `jobs` | `status`, `client_code`, `created_at` |
| `job_applications` | `{candidate_id, job_id}` (unique), `status` |

## 4. Seed Script (`backend/seed_mongodb.py`, 640 lines)

Run: `cd backend && .\venv\Scripts\python.exe seed_mongodb.py`
Reads `DATABASE_URL` (required), `MONGODB_DB_NAME` (default `bhiv_hr`). Drops collections if
`jobs` already has data (prompts).

| Entity | Quantity / detail |
|--------|-------------------|
| Jobs | 5 (incl. Senior Python Developer, AI/ML Engineer) |
| Candidates | 20 (random from a skills pool) |
| Applications | 15 |
| Clients | 3 — `TECH001`, `AI002`, `INFRA003` |
| Users | 3 — admin, hr_manager, recruiter1 (placeholder hashes) |
| Interviews | 5 |
| Feedback | 10 |
| RL | `rl_predictions` 10, `rl_feedback` 5, `rl_model_performance` 2, `rl_training_data` 2 |
| Workflows / offers | 2 each |
| Audit logs | 2 |
| Matching cache | 1 |
| Company scoring prefs | 2 |
| Schema version | 1 (`4.3.0`) |

> Placeholder user hashes mean seeded login credentials require re-hashing in production; demo

## 5. Schema/Index Management Scripts

| Script | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `backend/services/gateway/create_mongodb_indexes.py` | Create application indexes |
| `backend/services/gateway/migrate_mongodb_schema.py` | Schema migration |
| `scripts/migrate_interview_dates.py` | String `interview_date` → datetime (Motor) |
| `scripts/cleanup_keep_latest_14_jobs.py` (+ `.mongosh.js`) | Prune active jobs to newest 14 (preview/backup first) |
| `services/db/*.sql` | **Legacy** PostgreSQL schema (reference only) |

---

## 6. Workforce Lineage (schema-in-practice)

Workforce collections (`organizations`, `divisions`, `units`, `departments`, `employees`) wrap
records in a `LineageEnvelope` containing:
- `tenant_id` scoping
- audit/write hooks (`write_workforce_audit` → `audit_logs`)
- lifecycle transition metadata (e.g. `transition_type=employee_promotion`)

Hierarchy: **organization → divisions → units → departments → employees**. Lifecycle states and
transitions are defined in `app/workforce_common.py`.

---

## 7. Backup & Restore (operational)

- Atlas managed backups are the primary restore path (see `12_OPERATIONS_RUNBOOK.md`).
- Job-cleanup scripts create backups in the `job_cleanup_backups` collection before pruning.
- No local Mongo is required for normal operation; all data is remote (Atlas).

---

## 8. Verification Notes (2026-08-14)

- `backend/.env` contains a valid Atlas connection URI and `MONGODB_DB_NAME=bhiv_hr` (presence
  verified; value not printed).
- Gateway connects via Motor (async) — confirmed by successful local `/health` and app import.
- Collection list cross-checked against service source imports.
