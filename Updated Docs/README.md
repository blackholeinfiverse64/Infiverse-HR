## ⚡ 60-Second Orientation

- **What**: Enterprise AI-enabled multi-tenant HR recruitment + workforce-intelligence platform.
- **Backend**: 3 FastAPI microservices — Gateway `:8000` (172 ops), Agent `:9000` (AI matching),
  LangGraph `:9001` (workflows/notifications/RL). **204 total live API operations.**
- **Frontend**: React 18 + Vite + TypeScript SPA on `:3000` with candidate / recruiter / client /
  control-center portals.
- **Database**: MongoDB Atlas (`bhiv_hr`), 33 collections.
- **Ecosystem**: 9 integrated partner repos (Artha, ai-crm, Karma-Tracker, Prana, bucket,
  bhiv-registry, bhiv-intelligence-samachar, bhiv-SVACS, workflow-blackhole). Full profiles in
  `16_ECOSYSTEM_INTEGRATION_REFERENCE.md`.
- **Live production**: `https://sampada.blackholeinfiverse.com` — all services healthy (verified
  2026-08-14).

## 🧭 For New Developers

1. Read `00` → `15` in order (linear path, no skipping).
2. Follow `04_SETUP_AND_RUN.md` to start locally (verified: gateway starts in ~7 s, frontend build
   passes).
3. Use `06_API_REFERENCE.md` + `http://localhost:8000/docs` as your API truth.
4. Check `15_KNOWN_ISSUES_ARCHIVE_INDEX.md` before touching code that touches flagged areas.
5. For ecosystem context (partner repos, live state, gaps), see `16` and `BHIV_ECOSYSTEM_RUNTIME_CONVERGENCE_AUDIT.md`.

## 🗄️ Archived Documentation

All superseded documentation is preserved (non-destructively) in **[`archived/`](archived/)**
(131 files):

| Archived source | Copy location |
|-----------------|---------------|
| Root docs (README, QUICK_START, state, review, VANA, …) | [`archived/root/`](archived/root/) |
| Governance / control-center / Task19 docs | [`archived/docs/`](archived/docs/) |
| Handover package (00–13) | [`archived/handover/`](archived/handover/) |
| Backend docs | [`archived/backend-docs/`](archived/backend-docs/) |
| Backend handover | [`archived/backend-handover/`](archived/backend-handover/) |
| Frontend docs | [`archived/frontend/`](archived/frontend/) |

The obsolete source paths are added to the root `.gitignore` so they stop being tracked while
remaining on disk. **Nothing was deleted.**

## 🔗 Repository Roots

- Root readme: [`../README.md`](../README.md) (updated to point here)
- Code: [`../backend/`](../backend/), [`../frontend/`](../frontend/)
- Proof artifacts: [`../evidence/`](../evidence/) (live — referenced, not archived)

---

## 🔒 Constitutional Boundaries

- All dashboard / control-center / governance surfaces are **read-only observability** — no
  parallel execution authority.
- Escalation authority, schema mutations, security overrides, and final prioritization remain with
  System Owners **Soham Kotkar & Vijay Dhawan** (Sampada).
- Never commit secrets. Never delete files — archive instead.
