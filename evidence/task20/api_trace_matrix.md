| Workforce runtime | `POST /v1/workforce/employees` | Yes | `GET /v1/workforce/trace-replay` | `api_proof_workforce.json` |
| Lifecycle | `POST /v1/workforce/employees/{id}/lifecycle/onboard` | Yes | `GET /v1/workforce/trace-replay` | `replay_trace_proof.md` |
| Policy engine | `POST /v1/policies/evaluate` | Yes | `GET /v1/workforce/trace-replay` (audit correlation) | `replay_trace_proof.md` |
| Challenge flow | `POST /v1/governance/challenges` | Yes | `GET /v1/workforce/trace-replay` (audit correlation) | `replay_trace_proof.md` |
| Decision ledger | `POST /v1/decisions` | Yes | `GET /v1/decisions/replay` | `replay_trace_proof.md` |

## Notes

- Task20 write routes are wired to pass correlation IDs from gateway request state.
- Replay endpoints are read-only and used to validate lineage continuity.
