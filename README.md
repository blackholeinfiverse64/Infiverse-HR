## 🔒 Constitutional Alignment Rules

As a developer working on the **Sampada** scope:

- **Visibility Only**: All dashboard and intelligence features are strictly read-only on execution
  authority. You must not introduce parallel orchestration frameworks or state-mutating handlers.
- **System Boundaries**: Escalation authority, database schema mutations, security authorization
  overrides, and final prioritization remain with System Owner **Rishabh Yadav**.
- **Non-Destructive**: Archive rather than delete. Never commit secrets.
