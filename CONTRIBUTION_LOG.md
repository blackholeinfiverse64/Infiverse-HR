## Task19 — Demo credentials & URL clarity (2026-06-03)

- [x] **ARCHIVED DEMO LOGIN**: Documented `TECH001`/`demo123` as archived (not in production DB) in `docs/DEMO_CREDENTIALS_STATUS.md`; E2E/smoke no longer default to those values.
- [x] **CONTROL CENTER URLS**: Confirmed localhost shows local service URLs; Vercel/production shows Render URLs (`api.ts` dev guard + Vercel `VITE_*`).

## Task19 — Documentation & Production Sync (2026-06-03)

- [x] **DOC SYNC**: Updated Task19 evidence matrix, acceptance pack, review packet, current state, central control checklist/contract/plan, and README Task19 index to 2026-06-03 implementation state.
- [x] **PRODUCTION**: Render gateway/agent/langgraph `/health` verified; Vercel env documented with `VITE_LANGGRAPH_SERVICE_URL` (not `VITE_LANGGRAPH_URL`).
- [x] **E2E EVIDENCE**: Localhost `run_control_center_e2e.py` — 8 passed, 2 skipped (JWT env); offline + governance unit tests 10 passed.
- [x] **STALE REMOVAL**: Removed seeded-replay and rollout-pending-only claims from active docs; archived historical plan language in `CENTRAL_CONTROL_LIVE_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`.
- [ ] **OPEN**: Production UI smoke on Vercel `/control` and prod JWT role matrix (checklist §F).

## Task19 — Production smoke (2026-06-03)

- [x] **PRODUCTION SMOKE SCRIPT**: Added `backend/tests/e2e/control_center/run_production_smoke.py` — Render control-center APIs, audit write, Vercel bundle Render URL check.
- [x] **PRODUCTION RUN**: 15/15 passed against live Render + Vercel (`control_center_production_smoke_report.json`).
- [x] **CHECKLIST**: Updated `docs/CENTRAL_CONTROL_LIVE_EXECUTION_CHECKLIST.md` §F/§G; manual UI login + prod JWT matrix remain for real tenant credentials.

## Task19 — Runtime Governance Hardening (2026-06-02)

- [x] **POLICY SCOPE MODULE**: Added `backend/services/gateway/app/control_center_governance.py` with centralized role/tenant/org scope resolution and scoped stats/aggregates/audit queries.
- [x] **GATEWAY APIs**: Added `GET /v1/control-center/audit-events`, `GET /v1/control-center/audit-replay`, `GET /v1/control-center/dashboard-aggregates`; hardened audit write taxonomy; scoped `/v1/candidates/stats` and `/metrics/dashboard`.
- [x] **SERVICE AUTHZ ALIGNMENT**: Agent and LangGraph correlation middleware + health governance metadata; LangGraph `POST /rl/retrain` requires API key.
- [x] **FRONTEND LIVE REPLAY**: Control center uses live audit replay and backend funnel/dept aggregates; Command Center nav in client/recruiter sidebars when `VITE_ENABLE_CONTROL_CENTER=true`.
- [x] **ACCEPTANCE PACK**: `docs/TASK19_ACCEPTANCE_TEST_PACK.md`, `docs/TASK19_REQUIREMENT_EVIDENCE_MATRIX.md`, `backend/tests/gateway/test_task19_control_center_governance.py`.
- [x] **EVIDENCE CLOSURE**: Updated `REVIEW_PACKET.md` runtime proof table.

## Task19 — Central Control Live Wiring (2026-06-02)

- [x] **IMPLEMENTATION PLAN ADDED**: Created `docs/CENTRAL_CONTROL_LIVE_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` with the live central control scope, security requirements, governance alignment, integration points, test plan, deployment steps, and exit criteria.
- [x] **API HELPER UPDATE**: Added live gateway metrics and service health helpers in `frontend/src/services/api.ts` plus LangGraph environment support in `frontend/src/vite-env.d.ts`.
- [x] **CONTROL CENTER LIVE WIRED**: Replaced the central control page's static mock KPI arrays with authenticated live reads from the gateway metrics endpoint and direct Agent/LangGraph health checks in `frontend/src/pages/control/ControlCenter.tsx`.
- [x] **EXPLICIT CARD MAPPING**: Replaced the generic bucket-flattening approach with named dashboard cards mapped to explicit backend fields for performance, candidate stats, system metrics, and service health.
- [x] **TRACEABILITY (SUPERSEDED 2026-06-02)**: Initial wiring kept replay as seeded placeholder; same day replaced by live `GET /v1/control-center/audit-replay` + UI (`fetchControlCenterAuditReplay`).
- [x] **VALIDATION**: Ran `npm run lint` in `frontend/` (`tsc --noEmit`) and the updated frontend typechecked successfully after the live wiring changes.

## Task19 — Current State Reconstruction (2026-05-30)

- [x] **CURRENT STATE FIXED**: Rebuilt `docs/SAMPADA_CURRENT_STATE.md` with all 10 Task19 required sections. Sections 2-10 now fully populated: Ownership Matrix, Architecture Layers, SETU Relationship, Policy/Governance Model, Federated Workforce Model, Command Center Governance, Human Safety Framework, Current Implementation State, and Developer Entry Guide.
- [x] **STRUCTURAL FIX**: Removed orphaned evidence data, fixed broken formatting, added proper section separators, ensured clean document structure from Section 1 through Section 10.
- [x] **CROSS-REFERENCE VALIDATION**: Verified all section links reference the 5 Task19 boundary documents and supporting Task18 artifacts correctly.
